                    Congrats! You’re old enough to get your first credit card! Discover it Student Cash Back and SavorOne Student Cash Rewards Credit Card are great starter cards for students. Starter cards tend to have lower benefits, no annual fee, and a lower standard for approval. The purpose of these are to further increase your credit score/build up a good history so that you increase your chances at getting approved for a card with better benefits. 
                    </p>
                    <div className='cardbasics'>
                        Before we explain our top two cards, lets go over some credit card basics.
                        <p className='basicsinfo'>
                        There are many factors to think about when getting your first credit card for example How difficult it is to get approved
                        If a credit card is more difficult to get approved for, it's not worth risking the credit inquiry. Every time you apply for a credit card, the company will make a hard inquiry on your credit score which automatically lowers it. So basically, each time you apply, your credit score lowers. 
                        Another factor to consider is the Annual Fee.
                        As a student that is most likely spending and earning very little, it is not worth it to get a credit card with an annual fee.
                        Most cards with an annual fee usually come with benefits that only make sense for individuals who spend a lot, travel a lot, and use certain resources more than others. 
                        For example, the famous American Express platinum card has an annual fee of $695. The reason for such a high fee is its benefits. This includes over $700 of credit in various travel categories($200 a year for uber, $200 hotel credit, $189 a year for clear), $300 a year for equinox gym memberships(even though the monthly cost is already $300), $240 for digital subscriptions(Disney+, Hulu, New York Times, etc), and $100 a year at Saks Fifth Avenue. To sum this all up, it would only make sense to pay $695 a year if you would be saving at least $695 with the benefits it provides. If your current lifestyle doesn’t require these purchases, it wouldn’t make sense to get such a card. 
                        In that sense, with a card that has insanely good benefits, a cash back rate, or rewards/points rate, look at its annual fee and see if it’s truly worth it. Most cases, these sorts of cards only make sense based off of how much you are spending. 
                        “Don’t let the card dictate how much you will spend. Dictate the card based on how much you have already spent.”
                        Just as a reminder, as a student and new credit card user, our biggest goal is to build a good credit history so prioritize getting a card that’s easiest to maintain and think about the rewards and cash back afterwards.

                            Rewards and Benefits
                            <p className='innerrb'>
                            Nerdwallet is a great resource for finding cards that fit your spending habits and financial situation. 
                            Aside from building credit. The next best thing about credit cards for a student are the rewards. For example, getting 5% cash back on certain dining would mean that every time you use your credit card to pay for a meal at a restaurant, you basically earn an extra 5% of whatever you spend. This cash back can be used when you pay off your credit card. In other words, you are basically getting a 5% discount with this benefit. You could also transfer this money but it makes the most sense to use this cash back to pay off your credit card bill. 
                            Points are another thing you can earn with your credit card. To be honest, points are like % cash back rewards but inflated so that the benefits appear to be more appealing. Don’t get me wrong, credit cards that use a points system are still great but look into the conversion of points to see how much they are really worth in your actual currency.
                            Miles can also be earned. Again, they are basically another form of cash back but are typically most effective when targeting travel expenses. Again, look into the actual worth of miles and see if after conversion, that it’s a good rate.

                        <p className='thoughts'>
                        For the discover card, a couple things we want to highlight is that 5% cash back is an insane amount but the con is that you can’t control what category you are receiving cash back in. Sometimes it’ll be in a category you spend a lot in and sometimes it wont. However, the chances that you will receive 5% cash back for some purchase in your lifestyle is incredibly high. The first year cash back match is also a great bonus to get some extra cash. Overall, this card is easy to maintain and if you miss your first ever payment, you will be forgiven with no interest rate. 
                        As for the savor card, the 3% cash back is something that might be more attractive that the discover card. The one thing to keep in mind is that there are also several restrictions to this card so the types of purchases where you actually get 3% cash back may not be as much as you expect. For example, Amazon, clothing brands, Target, and Walmart do not qualify for 3% cash back. While historically, Discover has selected these options to be in their 5% cash back quarterly rotation. For dining, small groceries, travel, and concerts(entertainment) exclusively, this would be a good card.
