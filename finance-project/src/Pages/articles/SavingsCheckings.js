            <h1>Checkings and Savings Accounts</h1>
            <p>
            Understanding finances is a crucial life skill that everyone, especially young students, should develop early on. Knowing how to manage money wisely can pave the way for a secure and successful future. Saving money is a particularly important practice. By learning to save, you can set yourself up for financial independence, achieve your dreams, and handle unexpected expenses with ease. Starting these habits now, while you're young, gives you a head start on building a strong financial foundation.

            <h2>Checking Accounts</h2>
            <p>A checking account is like a digital wallet. Imagine you have a wallet where you keep your money for everyday use—like buying lunch, going to the movies, or getting that cool gadget you've been eyeing. That's what a checking account does, but it's all digital. With a checking account, you can:</p>
            <ul className='checkinglist'>
                <li>Spend Money Easily: Use a debit card or write checks to pay for things.</li>
                <li>Online Banking: Pay bills and buy stuff online with just a few clicks.</li>
                <li>ATM Access: Withdraw cash anytime from an ATM.</li>
                <li>Direct Deposit: Get your paycheck deposited directly into your account.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Checking accounts are great for managing your daily expenses because they make it easy to access and use your money whenever you need it.</p>
            <h2>Savings Accounts</h2>
            <p>A savings account is like a piggy bank, but way better. It's designed to help you save money for future goals or emergencies. Think of it as a safe place where you can store your money and watch it grow. With a savings account, you can:</p>
            <ul className='savingslist'>
                <li>Earn Interest: The bank pays you a little extra money (called interest) for keeping your money with them.</li>
                <li>Safe Storage: Your money is safely kept in the bank, reducing the temptation to spend it.</li>
                <li>Achieve Goals: Save up for big things like a new bike, college, or even a car.</li>
                <li>Limited Withdrawals: Unlike a checking account, you can't take out money all the time, which helps you save more.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Savings accounts are perfect for stashing away money that you don't need right away, helping you build a secure financial future.</p>
