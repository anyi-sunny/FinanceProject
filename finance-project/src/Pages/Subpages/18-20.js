                    Congrats! Youâ€™re old enough to get your first credit card! INSET and INSET are great starter cards for students. Starter cards tend to have lower benefits, no annual fee, and a lower standard for approval. The purpose of these are to further increase your credit score/build up a good history so that you increase your chances at getting approved for a card with better benefits.
