                    You can get a second credit card as early as 6 months after getting approved for your first card so if you havenâ€™t already and you have proven yourself to be responsible with your card you may want to consider opening up a second one. At this point, you should have three accounts open: your checking and/or savings account, your first credit card, and the one you are listed on as an authorized user.                     </p>
                    <p>
                    You will more likely be eligible for a card with more benefits and it truly depends on your preference/spending habits when deciding which one is best for you.
